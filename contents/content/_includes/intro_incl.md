# Introduction

`MIST` is a high level programming language focussed in security testing.

It provides with a very simple and univoque verbose grammar for writing playbooks,
and an SDK that allows yo to create commands that can be used from those playbooks.

All generated output can stored in a SQL knowledge database so playbook results
can be reviewed later.

The language also works as a glue between diferent tools and it can be extended easily.

`MIST` has a builtin catalog management system that allows you to import commands
written by other people. Command catalogs are git repositories that are cloned
locally to make commands available to you for usin from within playbooks.

Language comments are lines starting with `#`.
