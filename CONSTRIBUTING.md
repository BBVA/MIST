# Contributing

Want to hack on ``MIST``? Awesome! Here are a few instructions to get you
started. They are probably not perfect, please let us know if you feel anything
is wrong or incomplete.

There several ways to contribute to MIST:

- Contribute to MIST core
- Contribute to MIST built-in functions
- [Contribute to MIST catalog](mist/catalog/CONTRIBUTE.md)

## Contributing to the core and built-in functions

We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.
1. **Fork** this repo
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your forked repo
5. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest commits from **upstream** before making a pull
request!

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If
there's a problem with the implementation, you'll receive feedback on what to improve.

Submit unit tests for your changes. There's a great testing framework built in
in Python; use it! Take a look at existing tests for inspiration. Run the full
test suite on your branch before submitting a pull request.

Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation when creating
or modifying features.
